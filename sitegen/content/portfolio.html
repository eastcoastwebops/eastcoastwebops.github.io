<h4>E-Commerce Product Sort and Organize</h4> (desktop)<br/>
This is for an e-commerce I do work on, and the problem presented was that the products listed on this page are scattered all over the place. The goal was to <ol><li>QUICKLY write some code that would... </li>
<li>Group like items together</li>
<li>Allow navigation To Each Group</li>
<li>Be Dynamic in that if more products were added, regardless of where they were on page, would also be grouped</li>
</ol>

<h4>Customer Reviews (load, display, organize)</h4>
<a href="projects/reviews/index.html" >Click Here</a>
Loads a data file (for demo purposes this is a JS array containing comma separated data). <br/>
Typical Entry:</br>
<div style="font-size:12px;line-height:14px;">'7/20/17>Carol G.>Wolcott, CT>Sharon was professional, knowledgeable, polite and willing to go the extra mile to fix the problem I had with a replacement I had just purchased. I would recommend the site to others. Thank you very much.>4',</div><br/>
After the data is read in, it is then separated, an animated graph is built, the entries are written to the template, filtered, ratings applied, and I display 5 entries at a time, with the ability to filter by rating.

<li>
<h4>Scaleable CountDown Clock (to 4pm Today)</h4> (desktop)
<a href="projects/countdown/index.html" >Click Here</a>
Simple script to get today's date, then build a countdown from 4pm on the day you are viewing it, whatever day that happens to be. 
</li>

	<li><h4>Five Dollar Friday Simulation</h4> (desktop)
	<a href="projects/5dollar/index.html" >Click Here</a> <br/>
	Sounded like a good learning project to simulate what would happen with (x) amount of people putting in (y) amount of dollars every week for (z) weeks and see who might win and how much they might win. Assign names to each person and track those users over the course of the simulation.

<h4>CitiEasyDeals - Learn More Micro Site</h4> (Created for CitiBank)<br/>
<a href="projects/learnmore/index.html">Citi Learn More</a>
Most challenging part of project was to gather information about each slide's veritical position for navigation purposes and to write code that would intelligently parse out what you clicked on, what slide, button, what you opened, and send data for tracking. All of the Javascript is my original code, and the entire page was built by me.
</li>

<li><h4>Natural Language Random Poem Generator</h4> <a href="projects/storygen/storygen2.html" >Click Here</a> <br/>
	I created out of the desired to do something above and beyond the typical 'ad-lib' kind of story generators. This actually picks appropriate sounding / rhyming words from a pool of sounds, puts them together into a natural (if weird) sounding poem. The 2nd phase of the project was more proof of concept and that was to add images to go along with the poem. This became a challenge in that I personally didn't want to create all the images and simply got sidetracked. 
</li>
<li><h4>Sticky NoteS</h4>
<a href="projects/stick/quote.html" >Click Here </a><p>Random Order and Display each time.  -- Early Version - This project started out of a desired to (a) read in an external set of data (the quotes), and then (b) DO something with them kind of fun and (c) allow easy editing or adding of new notes by simply editing a text file in dropbox. Each page load randomizes the notes, the font, the rotation and various other little pieces of the css. Mission accomplished </p>
	<p>Try resizing the browser as well to see what happens!</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Sticky Note With parameters</h4><a href="projects/darknote/index.html?t=dark&c=quotes" >An alternative version</a> that accepts url parameters for theme "t" and content "c". There's actually only 2 themes and 2 sets of data but that was enough for building. <br/><br/>Try: <a href="projects/darknote/index.html?t=light&c=tips" >index.html?t=light&c=tips</a> for the "light" version loading the data file called "tips" 
</li>





<li><h4>Modified version of Citi's </h4> micro site for <a href="projects/cookie/index.html" >dynamic use</a><p>The goal of this excerise was to take base concept of slide content above but make all the <b>slides dynamically generated</b> and let the user <b>position them and have this position stored in a cookie</b>. So based on proving a list of names, a menu would be created, and the slides would be created and positioned. (Try dragging a slide around, then reload the page)</p>

		
<li><h4>"Gutsy Gals" Proof Of Concept micro site</h4> 
<a href="projects/gutsy/index.html" >Gutsy Gals (1)</a><p>The goal of this excerise was to create a nice micro / info site or landing page with some animation</p>		
</li>


<li><b>THIS Site itself</b><br/>
	This site is built entirely with Javascript and html and reads all the data externally and writes it out to templates. The menu builds out what is needed and how to create the widths for the css and generate submenus. Page links are generated dynamically and as a page is called it is read in from a raw html file and populated with javascript into the page template. <br/><br/>
	I created this concept much like I used to create php based sites where the page variable is read in from the URL and then from that, the site code can figure out what to do next, load the content, etc. Except this uses Javascript and can be run without a server and totally offline. I create only a few pages and template pages (2 cols, 3 cols, etc) .
	
	<br/> This is also responsive.

<li><a href="projects/math/projected.html" >Projected Math</a>&nbsp;- Basic example to project how X numbers over Y iterations and predict average. Idea came about because of football stats as in, if Running Back Bob ran for  100 yards in game 1, but 50 yards in game 2, over the course of 16 games (meaning average of 75 yards a game, what would he be projected to run for? This is all done in realtime as user fiddles with numbers. In theory, it could work for batting average or pretty much anything.
