<h1>The Ballad Of John And Mary</h1>
<div class="container scale">
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>It was 100 years ago today<br />
That Johnny walked into the night<br />
He turned his back on all that he knew<br />
Searching for what he thought right</p>

<p>Mary watched through her window<br />
She cared not what was the cost<br />
As Johnny blew a last kiss to her<br />
She turned away and Johnny was lost</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<p>If I am to find anything, he said<br />
I must set forth now and depart<br />
To find what it is I can&#39;t see<br />
But leaving her does break my heart.</p>

<p>A year passed by as he did travel<br />
And He wrote her letters each day<br />
But when he read what he wrote<br/> 
back to himself<br />
he threw each letter away</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<p>He yelled, <br/>i don&#39;t know what im looking for<br />
I&nbsp; search every night and each day<br />
I cant see what may be&nbsp; in front of me<br />
Only what has passed away.</p>

<p>One tuesday morning on her way work<br />
5 years after Johny had left<br />
Mary took the path heading east<br />
Instead of to work on the west</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<p>She cried i don&#39;t know what im looking for<br />
But I&#39;ll search every night and each day<br />
I cant see what may be in front of me<br />
I only want see my Johny today.</p>

<p>John yelled, Mary, I know what I&#39;m looking for<br />
But how many long years behind<br />
It is now very clear, it was you, Mary dear<br />
How Can I can go back in time ?</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
<p>Because i know now what i was looking for<br />
That i searched every night and each day<br />
I couldnt always see what was plainly&nbsp; in front of me<br />
It was you, Mary and I&#39;ll never go away.</p>
