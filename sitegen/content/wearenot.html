Among many of the LinkedIn flaws is that it assumes YOU are the COMPANY you work for. This is not how people as individuals think. Or at least we shouldn't think this way. 


Yes we (all of us) are employed and perhaps enjoy our employment, and follow all the rules and guidelines and give it our all day in an day out. 


But please stop this ME = Company total and absolute connection. 


We, as it relates to our careers and goals and personal success or failure are much more than the company we currently work form or any one company we worked for.  


We are certainly tied together at a point in time, and we do our best for 8+ or more hours a day. But Linked In needs to allow a separation too.
