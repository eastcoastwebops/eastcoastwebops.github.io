<h1><span class="sitename"></span> - Home</h1>

<div class="container">

<p>October 11, 2017: This site is in Beta mode while the remaining bugs and test scenarios are worked out. </p>

<p>This site is built on original code I developed to efficiently render my website, in a serverless environment, and in the shortest amount of time, without requiring any special third part apps or installs. </p>

<p>SiteGen as I call it, since I had to give the script a name, is entirely Javascript Driven</p>

<p>I call it "Site Gen" because it pulls all the pieces together, content, template, and urls for menu, and generates the site, and it's been a side project of mine for several months as I refine and tweak it.   "SiteGen" drives and builds the website dynamically, keeping content and template/structure separate. With that in mind, much of the content is placeholder content while I populate it with non-sample pages and content (something which I've been very slow to do). </p>

<h2>Tasks accomplished</h2>

<ul>
<li>10/12/17
<ol>
<li>Color Themes<p>Added core code with limited functionality, but currently only a black or white theme
Example: <a href="?page=home&t=light">Light Theme</a><br/><a href="?page=home&t=dark">Dark Theme</a></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>10/10/17 - Implemented CSS Variables but may opt to use "LESS" pre-processor since I'm finding pure css variables somewhat limiting.</li>

<li>9/19/17 - 
<ol>
<li>Rebuilt menu generation to allow "Nice Names" and ugly urls. If no url is present, then use name as url. This allows for linking to gallery page and append a parameter to determin which gallery to load into gallery page</li>
<li>slide up and down visuals for mobile version of menu. </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>9/3/17 - 
<ol>
<li>Fixed flickering issue on screen load</li>
<li>Fixed various ipad / ios related background image issues</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>8/30/17 - Greatly simplified how menu is built. Previous code was way too complicated in how it determined a top level menu item vs a submenu item</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div class="col-md-6">
<h2>Things I'm Still Working On:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix dropdown menu width to match width of each parent trigger</li>

<h2>What is the point?</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, I guess if I had tell you what my point was it was to learn something new and to perfect my programming skills.</p>
<p>I also like the idea of a &quot;template&quot; and &quot;content&quot; being separate items, where the &quot;content&quot; is very minimalistic HTML but is enhanced and loaded into the template.&nbsp; The template is programmed to know what to do with different parts of the content, even if the user or CM may not.</p>
<p>I also like the ability to create stuff fast. I don't want to have to figure out what to do with a new page. I just want to create a new page, the site figures out there's a new page and creates the menu and links appropriately. Not much different from a Wordpress or othe CMS type sites, except this is my stuff from scatch. </p>

<p>I also took the opportunity to <b>build out this site using responsive / mobile techniques</b> 
One of the areas I didn't spend too much time on with this site was the "Design" and instead focused my attention on the "Development."  As time goes on, I find one can get too bogged down in design and color issues and not really accomplish anything useful. I like to figure out how to put stuff together, but not as much anymore with what color paint to put on the walls.

<ul>
<li>I never have to FTP anything or go online to add new content, edit existing content, update the menu or css. I simply go into the folder on my PC (or on my phone), tweak the content</li>

<li>Each content page is a unique HTML file, loaded on demand, determined by the name on the menu.</li>

<li>The menu is built dynamically based on a list of page titles. The order of the list determines which items appear first (or left) on the menu. The list is as simple as:
<blockquote>"Welcome",<br/>
"How It Works",</br>
"Coding Examples", etc</blockquote>
</li>

<li>Each menu item then is keyed to look for a particular HTML file based on it's name. Welcome looks for... welcome.html and so on. This keeps the content separate from the template and allows the content to be very easy and simple HTML. To add a new page, you add a new item to the list (a new menu tab will be generated automatically), and you add a corresponding HTML file in the dropdox folder. Simple!
</li>

<li>Each page can have a unique page logo associated with it, and this again is as simple as creating a new image with the same name as the page. If it's found, it will be loaded with the page</li>

<li>Last but not least, the site is <b>"responsive"</b> and will flip on or off many items to work with mobile devices</li>
