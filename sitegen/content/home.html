<p><strong>East Coast WebOps</strong> is the name of my small, 2 year old company, that focuses on web design related projects, some graphic design, and on occasion, helping others learn to code or design for themselves.</p>
<p>So while I still primarily work fulltime or on contract as a developer, the company was created to better organize my schedule and work around a career focused on Web Design and Graphic Design.</p>

<p><strong>This site</strong> is built on original code and some basic design principals I developed to efficiently display my website, in the shortest amount of time, without requiring any special third part apps or installs.

                            <h5 class="center">A Crash Course in a juggernaut CMS</h5>
                            <p class="light">For the past two years I've worked as the sole developer on two Magento based e-commerce sites. I knew nothing about Magento coming into the job but I relied on my skills of web development as a whole, my e-commerce background from the previous job with sites for clients such as Allstate, Verizon, and Citibank, and one of the most important skills: <strong>The ability to learn anything new and build upon this new knowledge.</strong></p><p>  One site was focused totally on online internet sales, had about 3,000 pages and products, and did upwards of $6,000,000 a year in sales. My job was to keep it running well, add new features, add new scripts and code or customize/add on the existing codes, create new templates, manage dynamic CMS blocks and code, incorprate facebook and google tagging and specialized code to track product purchaes, and build new setions of the website. This was done with a combination of PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. </p>

                            <h5 class="center">Take the Time To Learn</h5>
                            <p class="light">One of the things I always enjoy doing, either during downtime or when a new project is proposed, is to see if there's a new way of tackling an old project or idea, or a new idea to tackle and learn.</p><p>Either way the point is to learn something new, or relearn something you knew but make it better with new skills and methods.
							</p>
														<p>
							One of the most challenging areas on e-commerce sites is the product page and calculating all the crazy variations of products, and doing it live as the use changes options. One area I was particular proud of was when I was able to <strong>take the 2,000+ lines of code</strong> used in the default Magento add to cart scripts, and bring it <strong>down to around 250 lines of code</strong>, AND make it much more flexible and easier to maintain.

                            	<h5 class="center">Write Once. Use Many.</h5>
							<p>
							An area I constantly come across and arguably is a pet peeve of mine as a developer, is as I'm examining websites and I start seeing content, html, text, lists, etc repeated and hard coded over and over. </p>
							
							<p>The selfish aspect to this is because I know someone will want ..me.. on a Friday afteroon, to update this content and that means I have to track down every single place it's used and update it and hope I don't miss one of them.</p> 
							
							<p>So some of my most rewarding times spent coding are examining these areas and developing ways to code these items into either a template or some other method a singurlar git of content or data or a list, can be used many times throughout the site, perhaps dynamiclly customized per use, by simply calling the original item. Write Once. Use it everywhere. No more trying to remember all the different places to update this similar content across a huge site.
