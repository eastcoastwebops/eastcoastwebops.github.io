<p><strong>East Coast WebOps</strong> is the name of my small, 2 year old company, that focuses on web design related projects, some graphic design, and on occasion, helping others learn to code or design for themselves.</p>
<p>So while I still primarily work fulltime or on contract as a developer, the company was created to better organize my schedule and work around a career focused on Web Design and Graphic Design.</p>

<p><strong>This site</strong> is built on original code and some basic design principals I developed to efficiently display my website, in the shortest amount of time, without requiring any special third part apps or installs.
