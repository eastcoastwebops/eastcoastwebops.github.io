<p>Although I have Fullstack development skills, I consider myself a Front Developer and I've been involved in web design and development for quite some time, having originally started as a Graphic Designer, but finding my career pushing me more and more towards the "Development" career.</p>

<p>It's not that I don't like Back End work but it's not what I LOVE to do. I am a visual person. I was always into Tech, into computers, and into graphic design and painting, but I never really had a chance to stop and take classes for this stuff unless you consider watching YouTube tutorials or CodeSchool as "Taking Classes."</p>

I've worked on the front end and back end code on ecommerce sites for Citibank, Verizon, Allstate, AARP and many other large companies and have been put in positions where I had to write code in JavaScript or HTML or PHP or Java or CSS or Jquery or PhotoShop or SQL or how to build a WordPress site, or how to use BootStrap or Responsive Design. I was just thrown into projects and had to learn. Fast. How to write a web service or file processor in Java, how to use templates with javascript and track events realtime in google analytics on pages with dynamic content. How to setup a customer site with 2 million records that could drive sales for the company by tracking who was returning to the site based on a coupon code I prepopulated in the data.

My favorite coding tools are simply a text editor, a web browser and Photoshop. With those three tools alone, one can create the most fantastic sites and projects that can be imagined.
