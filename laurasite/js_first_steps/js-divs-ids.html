<!-- id

The "id" in html is one of the most important way to "identify" define buidling blocks and structure for your site. 
Classes are another (example: class="red") and used with CSS (just like id's can be used in css), but ID's are supposed to be unique to a page.

There should never be duplicate ID's used in a website. Classes on other hand are used many times. 

You can still create element without ID or other identifiers..., but for Javascript the ones you want to work with
must have some sort of unique identification... the id. 

div 
the <div> is a  or division section of your site, just like <p> is a paragraph and others. But div is THe most important.
	Think of a div as a block on your page. It can be any size you imagine or define.. but it's a square or rectangle 
	block

CSS/Style
by using css we can visualize the location and size of the divs and elements more easily. 
we can create 1 global style to affect ALL 'div' to give them shape

and then create another one to give unique properties to he ones with an id

-->

<div>Undefined div</div>

<div id="one"><p> adding text</p> 
	<div class="red">Block One</div>
</div>



<div id="two">Block Two</div>


<div id="three">Block Three</div>

<style>
	div{width:50%;height:100px; border:solid 1px;margin:auto;}
	div#two{border-color:#ff0000;background:#aaaaaa;}

	div.red{ 
		border: 0px; 
		text-align:center; 
		font-size:30px;  
		color: red;
		 }
</style>
