<h2 class="inactive">Data</h2>
<div>
<p>Data is what makes us &#8211; it provides the backbone for everything we do. 
  We have over 30 years of experience analyzing data, creating attributes and 
  databases for specific purposes, and finding the right database for the specific 
  objective. We are truly data &#8216;agnostic&#8217; &#8211; we don&#8217;t care 
  where the data comes from or who owns it; instead, we care about what it can 
  do to help your business. This creates flexibility in optimizing solutions other 
  companies just cannot match.<br>
  <br>

<p>Our current databases include: credit and credit triggers, demographic/lifestyle, 
  underbanked/thin credit, payday, debt/tax settlement, auto year/make/model/vin, 
  internet responders, econometric/zip4, public record, fraud/id verification, 
  and club/continuity (change to links). This data consists of over 2 billion 
  records and over 2,000 attributes. This is the foundation for optimal solutions. 
  With this data we provide lists and appends for customers in all industries 
  from these databases.</p>

    looks like and their likely behavior, target marketing identifies these candidates

    marketing will create a behavior profile to help target those that are likely

    as upside. We have the data, tools, and know-how to help lenders optimize 
    their portofolio to take adavantage of the risk/reward tradeoff.</li>

<h2 class="inactive">Online Delivery</h2>
<div>
<p>Part of a solutions success is linked to the platform that delivers it. In 
  some cases, particularly online, real time delivery is essential to a campaigns 
  success. Having a partner that understands the space of real time solution delivery 
  will help you maximize your success when it come to offers where &#8220;time 
  is of the essence&#8221; </p>
<p>Beyond the standard lead validation that everyone seems to be doing these days 
  is advanced lead scoring. Using both our unique blend of data and analytics, 
  we have developed a superior model that allows lenders to determine the likelihood 
  that a lead will convert and pay; current methods found in the marketplace are 
  single dimensional identity validation tools, not multivariate predictive tools. 
  Lead scores can be delivered in both batch and real time to lead buyers, lenders 
  and marketers.</p>
<p>Our online, real-time lead scoring engine returns decisions to your platform 
  in sub second response times with scores and attributes being options.</p>
