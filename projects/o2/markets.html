<h2 class="inactive">Bankcard:</h2>
<div>
		<p>For bankcard, we have alternative databases that can drive more response, such 	  as econometric attributes (such as unemployment, risk, response, wealth), recent 	  marketing response (online, mail, telemarketing), recent trigger information 	  (such as move date, inquiry, . We also have alternative data to knock out riskier 	  consumers based on information such as poor checking history, high bankruptcy 	  likelihood, or recent poor micro lending performance. These two items create 	  a natural swap-set to improve campaign performance.</p>

<h2 class="inactive">Debt/Tax:</h2>
<div>
		<p>We provide turn-key marketing for both the debt settlement and tax settlement   businesses. Our full service solution includes creative development, data, mail   processing and fulfillment, and campaign tracking. </p>
		<p>For debt, we are an proven industry leader for more than two years. We have   approximately 6MM multi-sourced modeled names with high debt, responsive leads   that convert far higher than other sources. The modeling of multi-sourced data   is key here because there are qualified names from many sources (e.g. internet,   response, compiled) but you can&#8217;t know which are the best names from any   given source unless they are modeled. We frequently see mail response rates   of 80-100 bps, debt of $28k+, and conversion rates over 6%.</p>
		<p>For tax, we are also an industry leader for more than two years. Our turnkey   programs frequently return over 2% response rates, and low cost per close. We   have over 2MM modeled names in our universe from multiple sources (internet,   tax lien, response). For tax, we will also price our direct programs on a cost   per call basis so that there is a win-win for our customers. </p>

		<p>Whether you are acquiring new customers or retaining your current ones, you   need a partner that understands the differences between how each of these segments   perform. The balance between what you accept and convert directly impacts your   profitability in this risky lending segment. Our unique data sources will allow   you to better manage your portfolio risk in scenarios where you are applying   a generic risk solution or opting to implement a custom solution.<br>   If you are a lead buyer and need targeted payday leads, our network of partners   can deliver both short and long form applicants.</p>
