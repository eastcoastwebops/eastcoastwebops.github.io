        <textcomments>....Gatorvac is awesome.   They replaced my central vacuum unit a year ago and troubleshot a broken outlet wire in the attic at the same time.   Their prices are fair, and they show up on time. recently one of my pvc vacuum lines came off, and I was getting low suction.   Robert spent a half hour on the phone troubleshooting the problem with me, no charge.   honest, old school business.  Rare to see anymore.</textcomments>
