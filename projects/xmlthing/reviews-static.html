		....Gatorvac is awesome. They replaced my central vacuum unit a year ago and troubleshot a broken outlet wire in the attic at the same time. Their prices are fair, and they show up on time. .....recently one of my pvc vacuum lines came off, and I was getting low suction. Robert spent a half hour on the phone troubleshooting the problem with me, no charge. .....honest, old school business. Rare to see anymore.

		Have purchased and serviced my Miele vacuum cleaner at Gator. In fact, this is the second one I bought from them. They are very knowledgeable and carry bags, hepa filters and anything else you may need.

		I have an old featherweight Singer machine that I can't trust to just anyone. It's a simple, wonderful machine and it broke... I took it to Gator Vac and Sewing and it was back home in just a few days, in better condition than it was before it broke. It's been working like a charm ever since. I am so thankful for this business and their expertise!!!

		Wow! I called and explain that my whole house vacuum system would not work. They said they would send a technician out in about two hours. Joe and Ben showed up within two hours, diagnosed the unit and found that the motor on the 10 year old unit was fried. They had units on the truck with them and I was able to choose a replacement unit that fit my needs perfectly. They removed the old unit installed the new one and I was up and running in about thirty minutes. The technicians were friendly, polite , honest and knowledgeable. It doesn't get any better than this. Gator Vacuum is my new best friend!

		I came to Gator Vacuum for a repair and the owner was excellent and gave me an honest overview of the vacuum I brought in. Suggested different models that would do what I needed for my Condo. Knowing the brand I most prefer that he sold I looked to purchase a new model. He suggested based on my actual needs, to consider one of the used reconditioned models of my brand preference. Perfect! A savings for me even though a lesser purchase price sale for Gator. Just took the unit in for the recommended servicing to keep it optimal. The very best in honest service!

		Don't settle for less....When you can have THE BEST!!!!!! Now is the age of mega department stores, and mediocre service and just "ok" quality products. But if you want commitment to excellent customer service and a dedication to top of the line inventory you need to come meet Robert and his mom Phyllis. The owners for decades of Gator Vac &amp; Sewing in Coral Springs. For nearly 20 years Robert and his staff "lovingly" took care of my Miele Vacuum. He will know you and he will certainly knows what will fit your needs at any given time. The service is personal and friendly and his lines of superior cleaning have a reputation for excellence that can not be matched be matched by the come and go super stores of today. Do yourself a great service and drop by-- Meet their team and learn about what truly will make your life easier and healthier. They are the best, and you can forget the rest. Sincerely Yours, Nadine Hankin 1200 NW 80th Ave Apt 104 Margate, FL 33063

		I have had my 45-year-old Singer sewing machine serviced twice at Gator...once for cleaning and, just recently, for a repair and complete overhaul. Both times my machine has come back sewing like new. I feel fortunate to have a place like Gator to service my machine. They don't make them like they used to and I want to keep this one as long as I can. I just hope they are around as long as my machine!!

		Recently realized while trying to vacuum myself, not done for a long while that 15 year old Sanitaire Commercial heavy duty upright that had magnets in front to catch staples and paper clips used to use in office, had torn bag and broken belt. Tried cleaning and fixing myself after finding replacement belt had in a box. After doing this and saw rollers tight tried it and in a minute or so belt broke. So fortunately found Gator on line took the Sanitaire and Eureka Mighty Mite for bag and tools to great store and Robert totally refurbished Sanitaire at reasonable price and both vacuums working great and like new Ken Meyer Tamarac

		My overall shopping experience was excellent. Ben and Joe were running a little late, but they called, which I appreciated. They diagnosed the problem (my central vac was overheating and turning off). They showed me the damage done to the motor and recommended rebuilding the motor or getting a new central vacuum. I opted for the new machine which they had on the truck. The installation went smoothly and took less time than anticipated. They were efficient and clean. With so many accolades, why didn't I rate Gator Vac 5 stars? The one negative, which basically isn't the fault of Gator Vac, is that I was unable to shop around. I could not compare prices. Whomever I called to come to my home would get the job. To call another company would cost me another service charge. I choose to be optimistic and conclude that I made the right decision.

		Once again, Gator Vacuum to the rescue! A number of months ago, my PowerStar Optima Plus (central vac) decided to no longer work after a few weeks of acting "tempermental." I called a number of supposed repair facilities--including original installer--who each made clear they were more interested in selling me new vs. repairing my not very old existing system. Gator Vac sent a servicemen out--same day--who quickly performed a systems diagnosis; id'd "the problem"; &amp; made recommendations re appropriate overhaul procedures. End of day--my vacuum like brand new! Today, called around, looking for bags &amp; was told by 2 different companies that my vacuum was discontinued &amp; bags no longer available--would I like to consider a new vac system? Found Gator Vac's no. &amp; correct bags--plentiful supply--is now on the way to my house: No fuss/no muss--just GREAT service &amp; VERY PLEASANT/HELPFUL people. Nice!

The vac is fine and when I have called for service or a problem Sharon has always tried to solve it over the phone so as to avoid service charges. I had to replace the hose since it got an unfixable clog. They tried clearing it but couldn't either. They gave me a new one for a very good price. They take very good care of their customers. Highly recommended!
