My new SEBO is a great machine, and it is packed with features that you won't find in many other vacuums. Rob took the time once again to discuss all the features and benefits of my new SEBO. Gator Vacuum is by far, hands down, the very best place to go if you are considering buying a new vacuum. Kudos to Rob and his team of professionals at Gator Vacuum. Thanks for being the BEST!!

I called Nutune to get a name for another company to use. They gave me the name of Gator Vacuum. I spoke to Sharon and she was extremely nice and helpful. She had the service guy Todd call me. In a couple days he came from Coral Springs to Miami. Not only did Todd fix the problem but he was honest, friendly and gave us great customer service. I was only charged for the service call and they fixed my central vacuum that had been broken for 3 months. Sharon also followed through the whole process. \r\nCustomer Service is the most important thing in any company. Gator Vacuum not only has the best customer service they went over and beyond to make me happy. I will definitely use them again and get my new vacuum with them when needed.

An incredibly knowledgeable, friendly woman, Sharon spent alot of time with me on the phone, right after I dropped my Miele vacuum and well it was beyond repairing.\r\nI have tripped over, stepped on, dropped down a carpeted staircase and not a scratch before, but this day was different.\r\nIt fell out of my suv and fell upon concrete. As I was on a job, I needed to replace it asap. Sharon listened and after anwsering many questions, she came through with the perfect deal for me. She gave me an incredible deal, shared helpful tips about things I never knew about my vacuum and sent it out immediately.\r\nIt arrived well packaged, it was truly a blessing as I needed to continue working and I never missed a beat.\r\nFor heavens sake, if you are in the market for a new vacuum, there is no other like a Miele. I have been a customer for 15 years and they are the best. Turn your t.v. off when those Dyson or Shark commericals come on.....get a Miele and ask to speak to Sharon at the retail store. She is so wonderful, I promise....she will give you the time, have the answers to all your questions and after all, how many of you actually recieve customer service like that anymore? Thanks Sharon, love Thinkvacuum.com and my miele.","fullurl":"http:\/\/www.shopperapproved.com\/customer-review\/Gator Vacuum &amp; Sewing Co\/12324450","orderid":"7296363","Overall":"5.0","cancelled":false,"Video":"","private":false,"CustomerService":null,"public":"true","verified":"true","language":null},"11721620":{"name":"Gina","location":" - FL, United States","justlocation":"FL, United States","displaydate":"21 Feb 2015","textcomments":"I purchased a Miele vacuum two years ago and I absolutely love it!
