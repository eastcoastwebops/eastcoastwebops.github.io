<ul class="points">
<li><a href="https://citieasydeals.com/Learnmore" target="_blank">https://citieasydeals.com/Learnmore</a><p>Most challenging part of project was to gather information about each slide's veritical position for navigation purposes and to write code that would intelligently parse out what you clicked on, what slide, button, what you opened, and send data for tracking.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Modified version of CED</b> micro site for <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/cookie/index.html" target="_blank">dynamic use</a><p>The goal of this excerise was to take base concept of slide content above but make all the slides dynamically generated and let the user position them and have this position stored in a cookie. So based on proving a list of names, a menu would be created, and the slides would be created and positioned. (Try dragging a slide around, then reload the page)</p>

<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/r2hzw376j3q6gu0/AADs-49n1bRWALuDbM-1QZPDa" target="_blank">Designs Created for Work/Clients</a><p>A dropbox photo gallery with snapshots of websites, posters, mailers, created for work related projects. </p>

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/ekhgallery/index.html?gallery=websiteportfolio" target="_blank">Photo Gallery One</a><p>Javascript Photo Gallery Project using parameters to determine folder/imagesInvolves reading in parameter which determines which file to load to read images and then which folders to use (currently only 2 galleries in use - cities and default with blank images)</p>
</li>

<li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/ekhgallery/alternate.html" target="_blank">JS Gallery Type Two</a><p>Similar to the above and with my same core script to determine which file/folders/images to display and build html for, this is an alternate layout version. Same URL/parameter principal, but different layout concept - </p>
</li>

<li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/popup4wire/poplocaltest.html" target="_blank">Site independent Popup with lightbox effect</a> <p>Need to wait a few seconds until this kicks in. This script was created out of the need to work in a rather complex Wordpress site that did not like it's template or code modified overly much. I did not want to add anything permanent to the site if possible, did not want to modifiy the HTML or the template. <br/><br>So I came up with the idea of simply embedding a 'trigger' type script that would load the REAL script that was hosted on another site which itself build some temporary HTML into the DOM, and then go away after it was clicked on. <br/><br>You view the REAL site with popup at <a href="http://plantingpeace.org" target="_blank">Planting Peace.ORG</a> although please note that this version uses cookies to let the popup only appear once per day and only on the home page</p>

<li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/stick/quote.html" target="_blank">Sticky Note</a> <p>Early Version - This project started out of a desired to (a) read in an external set of data (the quotes), and then (b) DO something with them kind of fun and (c) allow easy editing or adding of new notes by simply editing a text file in dropbox. Each page load randomizes the notes, the font, the rotation and various other little pieces of the css. Mission accomplished </p>
</li>

<li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/darknotev2/index.html?t=dark&c=quotes" target="_blank">Sticky Note With parameters</a><p>An alternative version that accepts url parameters for theme "t" and content "c". There's actually only 2 themes and 2 sets of data but that was enough for building. <br/><br/>Try: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/508866/webcode/darknotev2/index.html?t=light&c=tips" target="_blank">index.html?t=light&c=tips</a> for the "light" version loading the data file called "tips" </p>

(note: images are samples only and many are not in place as this was for proof of concept only)</p>
