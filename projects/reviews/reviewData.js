	'7/10/17>Micheal H>Coral Springs, FL>Here is my review of thesystem.  I am very impressed with the unit and would give it 5 of 5 stars.  Easy installation. Much quieter than the unit I had previously. The order process went great. It needed to be delivered to the installation location by Friday. Pablo said he would insure it would be shipped that day (Wednesday) to make sure it arrived on time. Within hours I had email confirmation of shipment and it arrived the day it was needed.>4',
