					<div class="expand hideme">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</div>

					<h3>Making life saner and simpler for you.</h3>
					<img src="saneblurb.png" class="content_mainimage">
					<p>From personal experience, we know that our most important relationships can be upset or even broken because of a misunderstanding, miscommunication, or a lack of clarity over something we thought was “a given.” That’s why we develop books and agreements that help you take a sane approach in navigating some of life’s most personal and emotionally complicated issues by considering possible outcomes, asking the right questions, and providing smart guidelines in an easy-to-understand and user friendly format. We feel that just little bit of planning goes a long way to keeping our relationships sound. It’s just that simple.</br><br/>

					For our series of Family and Friend Agreements, we teamed up with Judge Lynn Toler from FOX’s Divorce Court, for her plentiful first hand experience with the issues addressed in the book. </p>
