<b>Motorcycles And The 286.</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">

</div>
<div dir="ltr">
I:&nbsp;<b>So can you quickly give my your background? Your early career basically, how did you get started in Front End Development?</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
E: Well actually I started my career working for an Architect in New York City, Carrington Associates. I guess I was always into computers but also had a love of artwork and design which was a strange mix at the time. I was about 19 or 20 I think. This was the late 1980's about the time...</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: So they hired you to be an architect or something?</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
E: .. about the time the black and white Mac's became more common. But No, to answer your question, they were looking to get their firm working on CAD systems but didn't know where to begin. They hired me basically to (a) research what was available in their price range (10k to 20k), (b) Learn it myself (c) Learn from their architects all their tools and how to draft by hand myself, and finally (d) teach them how to use it.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: That must have been a pretty intense first job.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
E: Yeah, not too bad. What basically came out of it was that I learned, or started to learn for myself how to design on a computer, but also I started getting into 3D modeling and design with some of the tools the CAD system had. But I learned how to read floor plans and elevations, dimensions, and it made me very detail oriented. By the time I left I knew how to draft the floor plans and was able to do the 3D modeling for a huge multi building apartment complex.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: What kind of machine did this all run on?</b></div>

A 286 running at about 20 megahertz. with maybe 512kb or a 1 Mb of RAM and a 20 Megabyte hard drive. Note all the M's there. No "Giga" anything yet. My Note 3 with 3Gb of RAM has about 3000 times as much memory as that computer I did CAD work on. We used lots of 5 1/4 inch floppies. One of the first "3D" models I created was of my motorcycle, a KLR-650 and it was rendered just with hidden lines removed. It took over 24 hours to calculate this model/scene. That same model could be calculated at 60 frames a second on today's pcs. That is just incredible when you think about it.
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: So, why did you leave?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
E: I think just boredom, being a little tired of the long commute. It was on 57th and 11th ave and the combined commute was like 4 hours a day. I also had bought an Amiga 2000 computer and was starting to get heavily into writing music, doing more 3D graphics and I guess just wanted a bit of a break from the office stuff. So I got a job at a computer shop. Ended up making, breaking, fixing computers and generally learning all there was to know about motherboards, CPU's, GPU's, etc. The Amiga was really the creative king of the hill at the time, the PC coming on strong though. Also this gave me access to all the new software on the market.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: Just picking up on something you said, you mentioned you had a motorcycle?</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
I had owned a bike since my first year in College when I was 18. That first bike was a 100cc Honda Dual Purpose bike. Was light enough to fit in a rack on the back of my parents K-5 blazer. We hauled it up to Vermont where I went to school in September of '86 and then I used it to visit a girl friend who went to school in Rhode Island, every weekend, nearly without fail, rain or snow or sleet.<b>&nbsp;</b>The bike topped out around 60mph. But if I got close enough to a tractor trailer I would draft behind it and it would pull me along. Kinda crazy when I think back to it.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: You rode the bike in the winter? In Vermont?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
E: Yeah. I think it was a 300 mile trip trip to Rhode Island. Weather in Vermont from November to March is pretty damn cold of course. I remember one trip stopping at a Howard Johnson's for a break but was so cold I couldn't move my leg or lift it over the seat so I just sat there for a few minutes warming up with the engine on.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: So I guess while we're on the subject, I'll get it out of the way: What other kinds of bikes did you have?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
<img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TaKMPxB3zn0/VSwQfLL3hwI/AAAAAAAAc1s/tKZFI6Ji9KI/s1600/June%2B6%2B-%2BJune%2B6%2B-%2BJune%2B6%2B-%2B18%C2%B757%2B-%2BDsc00363-1.Jpg" height="150" width="200" />E:&nbsp;After the 100cc Honda, that summer after the year in College, I got the job and had some money so I bought a Honda 600xl Dual Purpose but the thing never ran right, it was a kick start and simply refused to start correctly, and I had to return and exchanged for a used Honda street bike. CBR something, it was old though. 300cc maybe. A few months later I bought a new Kawasaki KLR 650. Was a decent bike but I had a few accidents with it, simply where the rear wheel being knobby and rather thin, just slid out from under me. One time was really bad and this was on the Bronx River Parkway going around a sharp corner as you came into white plains. Bike fell over, me with it, sliding across the parkway at 50mph and into oncoming traffic.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: Did you get hurt, go to the hospital or anything?</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
E: I had a bit of a limp because the bike fell on my right leg and then both of us slid about 50 yards. What saved my leg and foot from serious harm was that I was wearing steel shanked boots that absorbed the impact of the bike and sliding, although there was a huge hole in the boots afterwards. But that would have been my foot or leg. What saved my back and arms was wearing a thick racing leather jacket with padding on the elbows and back. Weird thing is I don't think my head or helmet hit the ground, I was kinda watching the whole thing in slow motion, on my back, looking down at my feet with the bike on top. Pretty vivid memory.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Probably the worst part was me then lying there in the road, in the oncoming traffic lane, and see a car come speeding up and stop about 2 feet away. Guy got out. Asked if I was ok and when I nodded, he then asked if I could I move out of the road because I was blocking traffic a bit.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Nice.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>I: So I'm guessing that was probably your last bike?</b></div>
<div dir="ltr">

At the time the fastest production bike on the planet able to do like 190mph or something insane. Bike was too big for me though. Too heavy. Couple years later I went back to the KLR, hated it, and finally ended up with a Suzuki RF600 which I loved. Perfect size. Crazy fast. Reliable. Light. That was about 2004 I guess and I got married in 2005. So somewhere in 2004 was my last ride on a motorcycle and I've never really had a desire to ride on again.</div>
