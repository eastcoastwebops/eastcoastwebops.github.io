            <p>Studies show that indoor air pollution is more detrimental to you and your family&rsquo;s health inside your
                home than outdoor pollution. Vacuum cleaning has become an essential part of day-to-day existence. Global
                weather is changing and pollution is at its peak; all this is bringing more dust and dirt into homes. Of
                course then there are children and pets that bring in more than just dirt. Somewhere down the line, the requirement
                for vacuum cleaners has become essential. Finding the right central vacuum cleaner can be a difficult task,
                hence central vacuum cleaning is the best option because it&rsquo;s reliable and functionally effective.</p>

            <p>There are many different types of vacuum cleaners. Canister vacuums, uprights, robot vacuum cleaners, and central
                vacuums. Now, a central vacuum is a vacuum cleaning system that is installed inside your home. Like central
                air-conditioning, a central vacuum system offers ease in vacuuming, besides allowing you to clean your house
                whenever you want with little or no fuss or mess.</p>

            <p>Let's take a moment to fill you in on our own professional thoughts, and what seems to be the latest trend for
                central vacuums. Venting central vacuums started back in the 70's and lasted through the 90's. People would
                either vent them up into their attics, crawl space, or outside away from the home. It sounds good in theory,
                but there are some major problems with doing either, which we will get into more detail throughout this page.
                One big reason is that venting your central vacuum in the attic or outside can lead to potential motor and
                heat problems, which could potentially cause a fire.</p>
