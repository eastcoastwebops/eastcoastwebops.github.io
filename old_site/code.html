                                Most challenging part of project was to gather information about each slide's veritical position for navigation purposes and to write code that would intelligently parse out what you clicked on, what slide, button, what you opened, and send data for tracking. All of the Javascript is my original code, and the entire page was built by me.

So based on proving a list of names, a menu would be created, and the slides would be created and positioned. (Try dragging a slide around, then reload the page)</p>

                                    <br />
                                    This site is built entirely with Javascript and html and reads in a menu file (a text file). The menu builds out what is needed and how to create the widths for the css and generate submenus. Page links are generated dynamically and as a page is called it is read in from a raw html file and populated with javascript into the page template. 
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    I created this concept much like I used to create php based sites where the page variable is read in from the URL and then from that, the site code can figure out what to do next, load the content, etc. Except this uses Javascript and can be run without a server and totally offline. I create only a few pages and template pages (2 cols, 3 cols, etc) .
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> This is also responsive. It is not meant to show off a cool design but rather cool coding. I'll figure out the design later.

                                    I created out of the desired to do something above and beyond the typical 'ad-lib' kind of story generators. This actually picks appropriate sounding / rhyming words from a pool of sounds, puts them together into a natural (if weird) sounding poem. The 2nd phase of the project was more proof of concept and that was to add images to go along with the poem. This became a challenge in that I personally didn't want to create all the images and simply got sidetracked.

                                    Sounded like a good learning project to simulate what would happen with (x) amount of people putting in (y) amount of dollars every week for (z) weeks and see who might win and how much they might win. Assign names to each person and track those users over the course of the simulation.

                                    <br />This script was created out of the need to work in a rather complex Wordpress site that did not like it's template or code modified overly much. I did not want to add anything permanent to the site if possible, did not want to modifiy the HTML or the template. 
                                    <br />
                                    <br>So I came up with the idea of simply embedding a 'trigger' type script that would load the REAL script that was hosted on another site which itself build some temporary HTML into the DOM, and then go away after it was clicked on. 
                                    <br />
                                    <br />Thus, all that was needed to do on the clients site was add the following code: 
                                    <script src="---(myownsite)---/pop_np.js"></script>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and this script would build an HTML div internally,  and insert this div, into the page it was loaded from. Without the Div or popup ever having to be added to the page itself. 
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> View the source of the test page, representing the clients wordpress site. The script builds its own div and content, then inserts itself into this code. It's obviously more impressive across domains, which this demo can't simulate.

                        <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">Although I have Fullstack development skills, I consider myself a Front Developer and I've been involved in web design and development for quite some time, having originally started as a Graphic Designer, but finding my career pushing me more and more towards the "Development" career. <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">It's not that I don't like Back End work but it's not what I LOVE to do. I am a visual person.
						I was always into Tech, into computers, and into graphic design and painting, but I never really had a chance to stop and take classes for this stuff unless you consider watching YouTube tutorials or CodeSchool as "Taking Classes."</p><p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">I've worked on the front end and back end code on ecommerce sites for Citibank, Verizon, Allstate, AARP and many other large companies and have been put in positions where I had to write code in JavaScript or HTML or PHP or Java or CSS or Jquery or PhotoShop or SQL or how to build a WordPress site, or how to use BootStrap or Responsive Design. I was just thrown into projects and had to learn. Fast. How to write a web service or file processor in Java, how to use templates with javascript and track events realtime in google analytics on pages with dynamic content. How to setup a customer site with 2 million records that could drive sales for the company by tracking who was returning to the site based on a coupon code I prepopulated in the data.</p><p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">My favorite coding tools are simply a text editor, a web browser and Photoshop. With those three tools alone, one can create the most fantastic sites and projects that can be imagined.</p><p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"><br></p>
